You are an expert code evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the CORRECTNESS of the following code solution.

**Problem:**
Title: construct-the-longest-new-string

You are given three integers x, y, and z.
You have x strings equal to "AA", y strings equal to "BB", and z strings equal to "AB". You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concatenate them in some order to form a new string. This new string must not contain "AAA" or "BBB" as a substring.
Return the maximum possible length of the new string.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 5, z = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: We can concactenate the strings "BB", "AA", "BB", "AA", "BB", and "AB" in that order. Then, our new string is "BBAABBAABBAB". 
That string has length 12, and we can show that it is impossible to construct a string of longer length.

Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 2, z = 2
Output: 14
Explanation: We can concactenate the strings "AB", "AB", "AA", "BB", "AA", "BB", and "AA" in that order. Then, our new string is "ABABAABBAABBAA". 
That string has length 14, and we can show that it is impossible to construct a string of longer length.

 
Constraints:

1 <= x, y, z <= 50

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def longestString(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"' to test your solution with sample test cases.
4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all sample tests pass.

**Your Task:**
Evaluate the correctness of this solution and provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the percentage of test cases you believe this solution would pass.

**Scoring Scale:**
- 1.0: Completely correct - will pass ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - will pass ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - will pass ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - will pass ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - will pass ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - will pass ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - will pass ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - will pass ~30% of test cases
- 0.2: Largely incorrect - will pass ~20% of test cases
- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - will pass ~10% of test cases
- 0.0: Completely incorrect - will pass 0% of test cases

**Evaluation Criteria (Focus on Correctness ONLY):**
1. Algorithm correctness: Does the logic correctly solve the problem?
2. Edge case handling: Are boundary conditions handled properly?
3. Input validation: Are all input constraints satisfied?
4. Output format: Does it produce the correct output format?
5. Completeness: Does it handle all cases mentioned in the problem?

**IMPORTANT:**
- Focus ONLY on functional correctness
- Do NOT consider code style, readability, or efficiency unless they affect correctness
- Provide a single score from 0.0 to 1.0 (can use increments of 0.1)

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining your score]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.
