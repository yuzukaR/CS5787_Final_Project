You are an expert code evaluator. Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i

Given an array of integers called nums, you can perform the following operation while nums contains at least 2 elements:

Choose the first two elements of nums and delete them.

The score of the operation is the sum of the deleted elements.
Your task is to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed, such that all operations have the same score.
Return the maximum number of operations possible that satisfy the condition mentioned above.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,4,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: We perform the following operations:
- Delete the first two elements, with score 3 + 2 = 5, nums = [1,4,5].
- Delete the first two elements, with score 1 + 4 = 5, nums = [5].
We are unable to perform any more operations as nums contain only 1 element.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,6,1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: We perform the following operations:
- Delete the first two elements, with score 3 + 2 = 5, nums = [6,1,4].
We are unable to perform any more operations as the score of the next operation isn'"'"'t the same as the previous one.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"' to test your solution with sample test cases.
4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all s

**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**

To evaluate correctness, you MUST create and execute unit test cases to validate the solution.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Completely correct - passed ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - passed ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - passed ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - passed ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - passed ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - passed ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - passed ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - passed ~30% of test cases
- 0.2: Largely incorrect - passed ~20% of test cases
- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - passed ~10% of test cases
- 0.0: Completely incorrect - passed 0% of test cases

**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments & Documentation)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation
- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation

**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency & Conciseness)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations
- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations

**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable
- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Correctness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Style_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Simplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Robustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect, with specific reference to test results for correctness]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.
