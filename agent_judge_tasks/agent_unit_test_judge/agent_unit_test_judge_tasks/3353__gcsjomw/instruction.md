You are an expert code evaluator. Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: existence-of-a-substring-in-a-string-and-its-reverse

Given a string s, find any substring of length 2 which is also present in the reverse of s.
Return true if such a substring exists, and false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: true
Explanation: Substring "ee" is of length 2 which is also present in reverse(s) == "edocteel".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcba"
Output: true
Explanation: All of the substrings of length 2 "ab", "bc", "cb", "ba" are also present in reverse(s) == "abcba".

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no substring of length 2 in s, which is also present in the reverse of s.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def isSubstringPresent(self, s: str) -> bool:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"' to test your solution with sample test cases.
4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all sample tests pass.

        """
        Find if any substring of length 2 is present in both s and reverse(s).

        Approach:
        - A 2-character substring exists in both s and reverse(s) if
          we can find two consecutive characters s[i], s[i+1] that also
          appear consecutively but reversed somewhere in s
        - This means checking if s[i+1:i+3] (reversed) appears in s
        - More efficient: check if for any pair of consecutive chars,
          the reversed pair appears elsewhere in the string

        Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of s
        Space Complexity: O(1)
        """
        # Get the reversed string
        reversed_s = s[::-1]

        # Check all substrings of length 2 in s
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            substring = s[i:i+2]
            # Check if this substring is also in reverse(s)

**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**

To evaluate correctness, you MUST create and execute unit test cases to validate the solution.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Completely correct - passed ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - passed ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - passed ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - passed ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - passed ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - passed ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - passed ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - passed ~30% of test cases
- 0.2: Largely incorrect - passed ~20% of test cases
- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - passed ~10% of test cases
- 0.0: Completely incorrect - passed 0% of test cases

**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments & Documentation)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation
- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation

**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency & Conciseness)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations
- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations

**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable
- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Correctness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Style_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Simplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Robustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect, with specific reference to test results for correctness]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.
