You are an expert code evaluator. Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: Medicines on Grid

There is a grid with H rows and W columns. Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. The state of each cell is represented by the character A_{i,j}, which means the following:

- .: An empty cell.
- #: An obstacle.
- S: An empty cell and the start point.
- T: An empty cell and the goal point.

Takahashi can move from his current cell to a vertically or horizontally adjacent empty cell by consuming 1 energy. He cannot move if his energy is 0, nor can he exit the grid.
There are N medicines in the grid. The i-th medicine is at the empty cell (R_i, C_i) and can be used to set the energy to E_i. Note that the energy does not necessarily increase. He can use the medicine in his current cell. The used medicine will disappear.
Takahashi starts at the start point with 0 energy and wants to reach the goal point. Determine if this is possible.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
A_{1, 1}A_{1, 2}\cdotsA_{1, W}
A_{2, 1}A_{2, 2}\cdotsA_{2, W}
\vdots
A_{H, 1}A_{H, 2}\cdotsA_{H, W}
N
R_1 C_1 E_1
R_2 C_2 E_2
\vdots
R_N C_N E_N

Output

If Takahashi can reach the goal point from the start point, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H, W \leq 200
- A_{i, j} is one of ., #, S, and T.
- Each of S and T exists exactly once in A_{i, j}.
- 1 \leq N \leq 300
- 1 \leq R_i \leq H
- 1 \leq C_i \leq W
- (R_i, C_i) \neq (R_j, C_j) if i \neq j.
- A_{R_i, C_i} is not #.
- 1 \leq E_i \leq HW

1 1 3
1 3 5
3 2 1
2 3 1

Sample Output 1

Yes

For example, he can reach the goal point as follows:

- Use medicine 1. Energy becomes 3.
- Move to (1, 2). Energy becomes 2.
- Move to (1, 3). Energy becomes 1.
- Use medicine 2. Energy becomes 5.
- Move to (2, 3). Energy becomes 4.
- Move to (3, 3). Energy becomes 3.
- Move to (3, 4). Energy becomes 2.
- Move to (4, 4). Energy becomes 1.

There is also medicine at (2, 3) along the way, bu

**Code Solution:**
```python

    # Read input
    H, W = map(int, input().split())
    grid = []
    for _ in range(H):
        grid.append(input().strip())

    N = int(input())
    medicines = {}
    for _ in range(N):
        r, c, e = map(int, input().split())
        medicines[(r-1, c-1)] = e  # Convert to 0-indexed

    # Find start and goal positions

            elif grid[i][j] == 'T':
                goal = (i, j)

    # Use BFS, but track the maximum energy we've achieved at each position
    # The key insight: if we reach a cell with energy E, we don't need to revisit
    # with lower or equal energy. But we can revisit with higher energy.
    max_energy_at = defaultdict(lambda: -1)

    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])  # (row, col, energy)
    max_energy_at[(start[0], start[1])] = 0

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    max_possible_energy = H * W  # Maximum useful energy

    while queue:
        r, c, energy = queue.popleft()

        # Check if we reached the goal
        if (r, c) == goal:
            print("Yes")
            return

                if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W and grid[nr][nc] != '#':
                    new_energy = energy - 1
                    if new_energy > max_energy_at[(nr, nc)]:
