You are an expert code evaluator. Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: Sensors

There are zero or more sensors placed on a grid of H rows and W columns. Let (i, j) denote the square in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. 
Whether each square contains a sensor is given by the strings S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_H, each of length W. (i, j) contains a sensor if and only if the j-th character of S_i is #.
These sensors interact with other sensors in the squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to them and operate as one sensor.
Here, a cell (x, y) and a cell (x'"'"', y'"'"') are said to be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent if and only if \max(|x-x'"'"'|,|y-y'"'"'|) = 1.
Note that if sensor A interacts with sensor B and sensor A interacts with sensor C, then sensor B and sensor C also interact.
Considering the interacting sensors as one sensor, find the number of sensors on this grid.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_H

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H, W \leq 1000
- H and W are integers.
- S_i is a string of length W where each character is # or ..

=== YOUR TASK ===
You need to write code from scratch and solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" which reads from stdin and prints to stdout.
Test your solution.py it
... (truncated for brevity)

**Code Solution:**
```python
def solve():
    H, W = map(int, input().split())
    grid = []
    for _ in range(H):
        grid.append(input().strip())

    # Track visited cells
    visited = [[False] * W for _ in range(H)]

    # DFS to explore connected components
    def dfs(i, j):
        if i < 0 or i >= H or j < 0 or j >= W:
            return
        if visited[i][j] or grid[i][j] == '.':
            return

        visited[i][j] = True

        # Check all 8 adjacent cells (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
        for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
                if di == 0 and dj == 0:
                    continue
                dfs(i + di, j + dj)

    # Count connected components
    count = 0
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if grid[i][j] == '#' and not visited[i][j]:
                dfs(i, j)
                count += 1

    print(count)

solve()
```

**Your Task:**
Evaluate this solution across 4 aspects, providing a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for EACH aspect.

**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**
Evaluate the correctness of this solution and provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the percentage of test cases you believe this solution would pass.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Completely correct - will pass ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - will pass ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - will pass ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - will pass ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - will pass ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - will pass ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - will pass ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - will pass ~30% of test cases
- 0.2: Largely incorrect - will pass ~20% of test cases
- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - will pass ~10% of test cases
- 0.0: Completely incorrect - will pass 0% of test cases

Evaluation Criteria (Focus on Correctness ONLY):
1. Algorithm correctness: Does the logic correctly solve the problem?
2. Edge case handling: Are boundary conditions handled properly?
3. Input validation: Are all input constraints satisfied?
4. Output format: Does it produce the correct output format?
5. Completeness: Does it handle all cases mentioned in the problem?

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on functional correctness. Do NOT consider code style, readability, or efficiency unless they affect correctness.

**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments & Documentation)**
- Are there meaningful comments explaining complex logic?
- Is the code well-documented for readability?
- Are variable names and function structures clear?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation
- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation

**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency & Conciseness)**
- Is the code concise without unnecessary operations?
- Are there redundant computations or variables?
- Could the logic be simplified without losing clarity?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations
- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations

**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**
- Does it handle edge cases and special conditions properly?
- Is the code maintainable and easy to modify?
- Is it extendable for future requirements?
- Are boundary conditions checked?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable
- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Correctness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Style_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Simplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Robustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.
