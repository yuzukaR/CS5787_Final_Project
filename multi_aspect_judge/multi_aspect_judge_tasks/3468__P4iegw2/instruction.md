You are an expert code evaluator. Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: find-the-encrypted-string

You are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:

For each character c in s, replace c with the k^th character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).

Return the encrypted string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "dart", k = 3
Output: "tdar"
Explanation:

For i = 0, the 3^rd character after '"'"'d'"'"' is '"'"'t'"'"'.
For i = 1, the 3^rd character after '"'"'a'"'"' is '"'"'d'"'"'.
For i = 2, the 3^rd character after '"'"'r'"'"' is '"'"'a'"'"'.
For i = 3, the 3^rd character after '"'"'t'"'"' is '"'"'r'"'"'.


Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa", k = 1
Output: "aaa"
Explanation:
As all the characters are the same, the encrypted string will also be the same.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
1 <= k <= 10^4
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def getEncryptedString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"' to test your solution with sample test cases.
4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all sample tests pass.

**Your Task:**
Evaluate this solution across 4 aspects, providing a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for EACH aspect.

**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**
Evaluate the correctness of this solution and provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the percentage of test cases you believe this solution would pass.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Completely correct - will pass ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - will pass ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - will pass ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - will pass ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - will pass ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - will pass ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - will pass ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - will pass ~30% of test cases
- 0.2: Largely incorrect - will pass ~20% of test cases
- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - will pass ~10% of test cases
- 0.0: Completely incorrect - will pass 0% of test cases

Evaluation Criteria (Focus on Correctness ONLY):
1. Algorithm correctness: Does the logic correctly solve the problem?
2. Edge case handling: Are boundary conditions handled properly?
3. Input validation: Are all input constraints satisfied?
4. Output format: Does it produce the correct output format?
5. Completeness: Does it handle all cases mentioned in the problem?

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on functional correctness. Do NOT consider code style, readability, or efficiency unless they affect correctness.

**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments & Documentation)**
- Are there meaningful comments explaining complex logic?
- Is the code well-documented for readability?
- Are variable names and function structures clear?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation
- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation

**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency & Conciseness)**
- Is the code concise without unnecessary operations?
- Are there redundant computations or variables?
- Could the logic be simplified without losing clarity?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations
- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations

**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**
- Does it handle edge cases and special conditions properly?
- Is the code maintainable and easy to modify?
- Is it extendable for future requirements?
- Are boundary conditions checked?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable
- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Correctness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Style_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Simplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Robustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.
