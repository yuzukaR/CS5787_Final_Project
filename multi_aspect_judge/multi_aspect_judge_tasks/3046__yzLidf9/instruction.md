You are an expert code evaluator. Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number

You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.
In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make num special.
An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = "2245047"
Output: 2
Explanation: Delete digits num[5] and num[6]. The resulting number is "22450" which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 2:

Input: num = "2908305"
Output: 3
Explanation: Delete digits num[3], num[4], and num[6]. The resulting number is "2900" which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: Delete digit num[0]. The resulting number is "0" which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.


 
Constraints:

1 <= num.length <= 100
num only consists of digits '"'"'0'"'"' through '"'"'9'"'"'.
num does not contain any leading zeros.

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, num: str) -> int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"' to test your solution with sample

**Your Task:**
Evaluate this solution across 4 aspects, providing a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for EACH aspect.

**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**
Evaluate the correctness of this solution and provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the percentage of test cases you believe this solution would pass.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Completely correct - will pass ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - will pass ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - will pass ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - will pass ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - will pass ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - will pass ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - will pass ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - will pass ~30% of test cases

- Is the code concise without unnecessary operations?
- Are there redundant computations or variables?
- Could the logic be simplified without losing clarity?

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations
- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations

**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable
- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Correctness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Style_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Simplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Robustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.
