Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: Weekly Records\n\nTakahashi has recorded the number of steps he walked for N weeks. He walked A_i steps on the i-th day.\nFind the total number of steps Takahashi walked each week.\nMore precisely, find the sum of the steps for the first week (the 1-st through 7-th day), the sum of the steps for the second week (the 8-th through 14-th day), and so on.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_{7N}\n\nOutput\n\nLet B_i be the number of steps walked for the i-th week. Print B_1,B_2,\\ldots,B_N in this order, separated by spaces.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 10\n- 0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n\nSample Output 1\n\n28000 35000\n\nFor the first week, he walked 1000+2000+3000+4000+5000+6000+7000=28000 steps, and for the second week, he walked 2000+3000+4000+5000+6000+7000+8000=35000 steps.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 41971 69399 37510 58209 74944 59230 78164 6286 20899 86280 34825 34211 70679 82148\n\nSample Output 2\n\n314333 419427 335328\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nYou need to write code from scratch and solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" which reads from stdin and prints to stdout.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample test cases.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all sample tests pass.\n' --allowedTools Bash Edit Write Read Glob Grep LS WebFetch NotebookEdit NotebookRead TodoRead TodoWrite Agent 2>&1 </dev/null | t\n...
