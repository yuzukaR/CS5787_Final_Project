Nevertheless, static analysis and manual enumeration of sample inputs (e.g., [2,3,6] -> 2, [1,4,3] -> 2) confirm the bitmask-DP with memoization implementation is functionally correct and efficient for n <= 14, so I rate correctness high but slightly penalize for the missing test run. The original submission contains many unnecessary wildcard imports and almost no comments, which harms style and maintainability, though the core algorithm is concise and appropriate. The approach is asymptotically optimal for the constraints and handles edge cases well, so simplicity and robustness receive good scores.\n", "extras": {"path": "/workspace/evaluation.txt", "impl_source": "oh_aci"}}
