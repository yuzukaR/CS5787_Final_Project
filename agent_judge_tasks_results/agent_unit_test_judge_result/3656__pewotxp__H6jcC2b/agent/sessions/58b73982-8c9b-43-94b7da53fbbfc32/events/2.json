Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-elements-in-array-distinct\n\nYou are given an integer array nums. You need to ensure that the elements in the array are distinct. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\nRemove 3 elements from the beginning of the array. If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.\n\nNote that an empty array is considered to have distinct elements. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7].\nIn the second operation, the next 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [3, 5, 7], which has distinct elements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,4,4]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 4].\nIn the second operation, all remaining elements are removed, resulting in an empty array.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [6,7,8,9]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe array already contains distinct elements. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1.
