The algorithm correctly computes lower and upper multiples of 10, uses the tie-breaking rule to choose the larger multiple, and returns 100 - rounded_amount, so it is functionally correct for all inputs 0..100. Style is penalized for many unnecessary and duplicate wildcard imports and module clutter though the function contains clear step comments. Simplicity is good because the solution is O(1) and minimal in logic, but the file-level verbosity reduces conciseness; robustness is high since edge cases (ties, boundaries 0 and 100) are handled, though maintainability would improve by removing unused imports and simplifying the file.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "7d380fb8e6f2", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
