Style is mediocre because, although the function has a clear docstring and brief comments, the file is cluttered with excessive wildcard and redundant imports that harm readability. Simplicity is good since the algorithm is optimal (sort then linear scan, O(n log n)) and concise in logic, but there are small redundancies like unnecessary imports and a needless assignment to nums[median_pos]. Robustness is strong: the code handles odd/even lengths, large values, and adheres to constraints, though maintainability would improve by removing the noisy imports and trimming unused code.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "5e51fbae7111", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
