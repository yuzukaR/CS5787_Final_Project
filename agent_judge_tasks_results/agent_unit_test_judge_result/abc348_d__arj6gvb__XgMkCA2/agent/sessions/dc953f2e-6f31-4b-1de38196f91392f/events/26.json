Style is concise with clear variable names and brief comments (BFS and pruning are explained), but it lacks a module docstring and some explanatory comments for the pruning logic, so I give 0.8. Simplicity is high because the solution uses an efficient BFS with per-cell best-energy pruning and minimal extra logic (one minor unused variable), so 0.9. Robustness is good: the code handles the problem constraints and tested edge cases, but has small maintainability issues (no explicit S/T validation, unused variable) so I score 0.8.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "bbb079029c23", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
