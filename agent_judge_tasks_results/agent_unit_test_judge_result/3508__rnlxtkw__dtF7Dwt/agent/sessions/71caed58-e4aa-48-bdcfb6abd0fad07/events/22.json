Style_Score is low (0.4) because the implementation contains many unnecessary and wildcard imports, duplicate imports, and other top-level noise that hurt readability despite brief comments. Simplicity_Score is good (0.8) because the core algorithm is concise and optimal (feasibility check via bitmask and counting differing 1-bits), though it could be slightly shorter by using int.bit_count or bin().count and removing import clutter. Robustness_Score is 0.8 since the code correctly handles edge cases (including k=0) and runs efficiently for the constraints, but maintainability is reduced by the noisy imports and non-idiomatic module-level setup.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "2ada870a197e", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
