Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special\n\nYou are given a string word and an integer k.\nWe consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.\nHere, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.\nReturn the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: word = \"aabcaba\", k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of \"a\" and 1 occurrence of \"c\". Therefore, word becomes equal to \"baba\" where freq('\"'\"'a'\"'\"') == freq('\"'\"'b'\"'\"') == 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: word = \"dabdcbdcdcd\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of \"a\" and 1 occurrence of \"d\". Therefore, word becomes equal to \"bdcbdcdcd\" where freq('\"'\"'b'\"'\"') == 2, freq('\"'\"'c'\"'\"') == 3, and freq('\"'\"'d'\"'\"') == 4.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: word = \"aaabaaa\", k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of \"b\". Therefore, word becomes equal to \"aaaaaa\" where each letter'\"'\"'s frequency is now uniformly 6.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word.length <= 10^5\n0 <= k <= 10^5\nword consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumDeletions(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample test cases.\n4. If tests fail, analyze t\n...
