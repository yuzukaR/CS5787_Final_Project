I validated correctness by reviewing the implementation and hand-calculating the provided examples: 'abc' -> 148 and 'zaza' -> 160; the function computes reversed alphabet index as ord('z')-ord(char)+1 and multiplies by 1-based position, which is correct for all lowercase letters. The algorithm is O(n) time and minimal memory so it's efficient, but the top of the file contains many unnecessary wildcard and duplicate imports which harms style and maintainability. Edge cases such as empty string and standard lowercase constraints are handled, but the code is not defensive against unexpected input types or uppercase letters.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,200p' evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "39894fc08348", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
