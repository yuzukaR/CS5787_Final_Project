Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number\n\nYou are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.\nIn one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make num special.\nAn integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = \"2245047\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Delete digits num[5] and num[6]. The resulting number is \"22450\" which is special since it is divisible by 25.\nIt can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num = \"2908305\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Delete digits num[3], num[4], and num[6]. The resulting number is \"2900\" which is special since it is divisible by 25.\nIt can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: num = \"10\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Delete digit num[0]. The resulting number is \"0\" which is special since it is divisible by 25.\nIt can be shown that 1 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num.length <= 100\nnum only consists of digits '\"'\"'0'\"'\"' through '\"'\"'9'\"'\"'.\nnum does not contain any leading zeros.\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperations(self, num: str) -> int:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample \n...
