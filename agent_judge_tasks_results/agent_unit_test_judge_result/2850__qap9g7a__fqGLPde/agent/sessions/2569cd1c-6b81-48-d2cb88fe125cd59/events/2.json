Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: construct-the-longest-new-string\n\nYou are given three integers x, y, and z.\nYou have x strings equal to \"AA\", y strings equal to \"BB\", and z strings equal to \"AB\". You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concatenate them in some order to form a new string. This new string must not contain \"AAA\" or \"BBB\" as a substring.\nReturn the maximum possible length of the new string.\nA substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: x = 2, y = 5, z = 1\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: We can concactenate the strings \"BB\", \"AA\", \"BB\", \"AA\", \"BB\", and \"AB\" in that order. Then, our new string is \"BBAABBAABBAB\". \nThat string has length 12, and we can show that it is impossible to construct a string of longer length.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: x = 3, y = 2, z = 2\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: We can concactenate the strings \"AB\", \"AB\", \"AA\", \"BB\", \"AA\", \"BB\", and \"AA\" in that order. Then, our new string is \"ABABAABBAABBAA\". \nThat string has length 14, and we can show that it is impossible to construct a string of longer length.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= x, y, z <= 50\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def longestString(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample test cases.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.\n5.
