Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3.

For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n* Shell options: Do NOT use `set -e`, `set -eu`, or `set -euo pipefail` in shell scripts or commands in this environment. The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions. If you want to run multi-line bash commands, write the commands to a file and then run it, instead.\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n",

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n",

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n",

(truncated for brevity)\n\n**Code Solution:**\n```python\ndef solve(n, k, s):\n    # Convert string to list for easier manipulation\n    cells = list(s)\n    operations = 0\n\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        # Find the next black cell\n        if cells[i] == 'B':\n            # Found a black cell at position i\n            # Perform an operation starting at position max(0, i - k + 1) to cover this black cell\n            # But we want to extend as far right as possible\n            # So the operation should start at position i (if possible) and go until i + k - 1\n            # Or if i + k > n, we adjust to end at n - 1\n\n            # The operation covers cells from position i to position min(i + k - 1, n - 1)\n            # But we need to ensure we cover cell i\n            # So we should place the operation to cover [i, min(i + k - 1, n - 1)]\n            start = max(0, i)  # We could also optimize by going back\n            end = min(i + k - 1, n - 1)\n\n            # Actually, let me reconsider\n            # When we find a black cell at position i, we want to place an operation\n            # that covers it and extends as far right as possible\n            # The rightmost position we can start is i (to cover this black cell)\n            # and it will cover up to i + k - 1\n\n            # But if i + k - 1 >= n, we might want to start earlier to use the full range\n            # Actually no, we just want to cover i to min(i + k - 1, n - 1)\n\n            # Mark cells from i to min(i + k - 1, n - 1) as white\n            for j in range(i, min(i + k, n)):\n                cells[j] = 'W'\n\n            operations += 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return operations\n\n# Read input\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    s = input().strip()\n    print(solve(n, k, s))\n```\n\n**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**\n\nTo evaluate correctness, you MUST create and execute unit test cases to validate the solution.\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Completely correct - passed ALL test cases (100%)\n- 0.9: Nearly perfect - passed ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues\n- 0.8: Mostly correct - passed ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail\n- 0.7: Largely correct - passed ~70% of test cases, notable gaps\n- 0.6: Somewhat correct - passed ~60% of test cases, significant issues\n- 0.5: Partially correct - passed ~50% of test cases, major flaws\n- 0.4: Limited correctness - passed ~40% of test cases\n- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - passed ~30% of test cases\n- 0.2: Largely incorrect - passed ~20% of test cases\n- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - passed ~10% of test cases\n- 0.0: Completely incorrect - passed 0% of test cases\n\n**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments & Documentation)**\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections\n- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear\n- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation\n\n**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency & Conciseness)**\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies\n- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code\n- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations\n\n**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable\n- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain\n- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend\n\n**Required Action:**\nCreate a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:\n```\nCorrectness_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nStyle_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nSimplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nRobustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nReasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect, with specific reference to test results for correctness]\n```\n\nDo not provide any other output.

I attempted to run an automated brute-force test harness I wrote (and saved to solution.py) to exhaustively compare the candidate to a BFS brute-force solver, but the execution environment lacked a Python interpreter so I could not run those tests here. Style is lowered because the code contains many inlined thought-comments and unused variables which reduce clarity. Simplicity and robustness are high: the approach is linear-time and memory-efficient within the problem constraints, though the input handling assumes nicely formatted input (it doesn't skip blank lines) and the code could be marginally cleaned (skip ahead by k) for readability.",
