The implementation uses the standard balance-based DP (balance never negative, final balance zero) and thus is functionally correct and should produce the sample outputs (e.g. sample 1 -> 2, sample 2 -> 0). The code is clearly structured with brief inline comments but lacks a module docstring and some naming could be improved, so I deducted a bit on style. The algorithm is concise and O(n^2) which is acceptable, but it uses a full 2D table instead of a rolling array which increases memory usage and slightly decreases maintainability, so I gave slightly reduced simplicity/robustness scores.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,200p' evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "762e2f0cf4a7", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
