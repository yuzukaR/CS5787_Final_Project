The code includes clear, focused comments for key sections but is not extensively documented, so style is good but not perfect. The implementation is time-efficient (O(T)) and concise, but it unnecessarily allocates an N x N marked grid (O(N^2) memory) which is avoidable and may strain memory for N up to 2000. Overall the solution is correct and maintainable, though it could be improved by removing the full grid to reduce memory usage.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,120p' evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "58d288990e75", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
