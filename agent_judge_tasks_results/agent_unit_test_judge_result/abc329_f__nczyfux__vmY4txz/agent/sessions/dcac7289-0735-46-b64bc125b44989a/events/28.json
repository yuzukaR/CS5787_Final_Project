However, it does not use small-to-large (merge-by-size) optimization when merging color dictionaries, so its worst-case time complexity can be quadratic and will likely TLE on adversarial large inputs under the problem constraints; this is why Correctness is reduced. Style is modest: there are brief helpful comments and clear variable names but minimal documentation. Simplicity is average because the code is concise and easy to follow but misses the key efficiency trick; robustness is likewise middling since edge cases (empty boxes) are handled but the approach is not scalable or optimal for large inputs.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "c4a52c3971b6", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
