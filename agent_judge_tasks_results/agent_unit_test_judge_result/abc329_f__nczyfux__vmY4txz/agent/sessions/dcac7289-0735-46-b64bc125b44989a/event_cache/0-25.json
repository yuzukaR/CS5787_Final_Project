The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`.

(truncated for brevity)\n\n**Code Solution:**\n```python\ndef main():\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # Initialize boxes with color counts\n    # boxes[i] is a dictionary where keys are colors and values are counts\n    boxes = [dict() for _ in range(N + 1)]\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        color = colors[i]\n        box_idx = i + 1  # boxes are 1-indexed\n        if color not in boxes[box_idx]:\n            boxes[box_idx][color] = 0\n        boxes[box_idx][color] += 1\n\n    # Process queries\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n        # Move all balls from box a to box b\n        for color, count in boxes[a].items():\n            if color not in boxes[b]:\n                boxes[b][color] = 0\n            boxes[b][color] += count\n\n        # Clear box a\n        boxes[a].clear()\n\n        # Print number of distinct colors in box b\n        print(len(boxes[b]))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**\n\nTo evaluate correctness, you MUST create and execute unit test cases to validate the solution.\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Completely correct - passed ALL test cases (100%)\n- 0.9: Nearly perfect - passed ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues\n- 0.8: Mostly correct - passed ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail\n- 0.7: Largely correct - passed ~70% of test cases, notable gaps\n- 0.6: Somewhat correct - passed ~60% of test cases, significant issues\n- 0.5: Partially correct - passed ~50% of test cases, major flaws\n- 0.4: Limited correctness - passed ~40% of test cases\n- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - passed ~30% of test cases\n- 0.2: Largely incorrect - passed ~20% of test cases\n- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - passed ~10% of test cases\n- 0.0: Completely incorrect - passed 0% of test cases\n\n**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments & Documentation)**\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections\n- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear\n- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation\n\n**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency & Conciseness)**\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies\n- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code\n- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations\n\n**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability & Edge Case Handling)**\n\nScoring Scale:\n- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable\n- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain\n- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend\n\n**Required Action:**\nCreate a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:\n```\nCorrectness_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nStyle_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nSimplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nRobustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]\nReasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect, with specific reference to test results for correctness]\n```\n\nDo not provide any other output.
