The code has a clear docstring and brief comments, but the file contains a very large number of unnecessary and wildcard imports which harms readability and professional style, so I rated style as moderate. The approach is simple and appropriate for the problem constraints (using a set of covered integer points); it is concise and efficient enough given start/end <= 100, though interval-merging would be slightly more optimal and removing import bloat would improve conciseness. The solution handles edge cases (single-point intervals, overlapping and adjacent intervals) and is robust for the specified constraints, but maintainability is reduced by excessive imports and wildcard usage.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "c55ad5a5527e", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
