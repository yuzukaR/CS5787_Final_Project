Style is middling because the function has a clear docstring but the file contains many unnecessary wildcard and duplicate imports that hurt readability and maintainability (0.5). Simplicity is good (0.7) since the core algorithm is concise and appropriate for n<=100, though it is O(n^2) and could be optimized to O(n) by checking reversed pairs with a set. Robustness is reasonable (0.7): the code handles edge cases like lengths <2 and repeated characters, but the excessive imports and lack of runnable tests in this environment reduce maintainability and confidence.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,200p' /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "39eec6cd5024", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
