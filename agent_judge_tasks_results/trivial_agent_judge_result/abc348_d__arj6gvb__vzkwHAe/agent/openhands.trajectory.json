Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.",

The state of each cell is represented by the character A_{i,j}, which means the following:\n\n- .: An empty cell.\n- #: An obstacle.\n- S: An empty cell and the start point.\n- T: An empty cell and the goal point.\n\nTakahashi can move from his current cell to a vertically or horizontally adjacent empty cell by consuming 1 energy. He cannot move if his energy is 0, nor can he exit the grid.\nThere are N medicines in the grid. The i-th medicine is at the empty cell (R_i, C_i) and can be used to set the energy to E_i. Note that the energy does not necessarily increase. He can use the medicine in his current cell. The used medicine will disappear.\nTakahashi starts at the start point with 0 energy and wants to reach the goal point.
