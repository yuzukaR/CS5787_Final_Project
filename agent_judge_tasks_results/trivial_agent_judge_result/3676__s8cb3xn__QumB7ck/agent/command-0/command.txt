**Problem:**
Title: smallest-number-with-all-set-bits

You are given a positive number n.
Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n, such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 7
Explanation:
The binary representation of 7 is "111".

Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation:
The binary representation of 15 is "1111".

Example 3:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representation of 3 is "11".

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def smallestNumber(self, n: int) -> int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"' to test your solution with sample test cases.
4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all sample tests pass.

**Your Task:**
Evaluate this solution and provide a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how likely it is to correctly solve the problem.

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 1.0: Perfect solution, correctly handles all cases including edge cases
- 0.8-0.9: Very strong solution, likely correct with minor potential concerns
- 0.6-0.7: Good solution, but has some notable issues or missing edge cases
- 0.4-0.5: Partial solution with significant correctness concerns
- 0.2-0.3: Poor solution with major logical flaws
- 0.0-0.1: Completely incorrect or doesn'"'"'t address the problem

**Analysis Criteria:**
1. Does the algorithm logic correctly solve the problem?
2. Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, boundaries, special values)?
3. Is the time/space complexity acceptable for given constraints?
4. Are there any obvious bugs or logical errors?

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining your score]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.' 2>&1 </dev/null | tee /logs/agent/openhands.txt
