**Problem:**
Title: ARC Division

AtCoder Regular Contest (ARC) is divided into two divisions.

- In ARC Div. 1, participants whose rating at the start of the contest is between 1600 and 2799, inclusive, are subject to rating updates.
- In ARC Div. 2, participants whose rating at the start of the contest is between 1200 and 2399, inclusive, are subject to rating updates.

Takahashi decided to participate in N ARCs.
Initially, his rating is R.
The i-th (1\leq i\leq N) ARC is Div. D _ i, and his performance in that contest is represented by an integer A _ i.
If he is subject to a rating update in the i-th ARC, let T be his rating at the start of that contest. Then, after the contest, his rating becomes T+A _ i.
If his is not subject to a rating update, his rating does not change.
Rating updates for ARCs are performed immediately after the contest ends, and whether he is subject to rating updates in the next contest is determined based on his rating after the update.
Find his rating after finishing the N ARCs.
He does not participate in any contests other than these N ARCs, and his rating does not change in other ways.

Input

The input is given in the following format from Standard Input:
N R
D _ 1 A _ 1
D _ 2 A _ 2
\vdots
D _ N A _ N

Output

Print Takahashi'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'s rating after finishing the N ARCs.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 100
- 0\leq R\leq 4229
- 1\leq D _ i\leq 2\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- -1000\leq A _ i\leq 1000\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 1255
2 900
1 521
2 600
1 52

Sample Output 1

2728

Initially, Takahashi'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'s rating is 1255.
For each contest, Takahashi'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'s rating changes as follows:

- The 1st ARC is Div. 2. He is subject to rating updates, so his rating becomes 1255+900=2155.
- The 2nd ARC is Div. 1. He is subject to rating updates, so his rating becomes 2155+521=2676.
- The 3rd ARC is Div. 2. He is not subject to rating updates, so his rating does not change.
- The 4th ARC is Div. 1. He is subject to rating updates, so his rati

**Code Solution:**
```python
n, r = map(int, input().split())

for _ in range(n):
    d, a = map(int, input().split())

    # Check if eligible for rating update based on division
    if d == 1:
        # Div. 1: rating between 1600 and 2799
        if 1600 <= r <= 2799:
            r += a
    else:  # d == 2
        # Div. 2: rating between 1200 and 2399
        if 1200 <= r <= 2399:
            r += a

print(r)
```

**Your Task:**
Evaluate this solution and provide a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how likely it is to correctly solve the problem.

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 1.0: Perfect solution, correctly handles all cases including edge cases
- 0.8-0.9: Very strong solution, likely correct with minor potential concerns
- 0.6-0.7: Good solution, but has some notable issues or missing edge cases
- 0.4-0.5: Partial solution with significant correctness concerns
- 0.2-0.3: Poor solution with major logical flaws
- 0.0-0.1: Completely incorrect or doesn'"'"'t address the problem

**Analysis Criteria:**
1. Does the algorithm logic correctly solve the problem?
2. Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, boundaries, special values)?
3. Is the time/space complexity acceptable for given constraints?
4. Are there any obvious bugs or logical errors?

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining your score]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.' 2>&1 </dev/null | tee /logs/agent/openhands.txt
