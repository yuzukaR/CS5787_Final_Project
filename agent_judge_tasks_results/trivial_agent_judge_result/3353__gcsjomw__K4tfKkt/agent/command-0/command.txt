**Problem:**
Title: existence-of-a-substring-in-a-string-and-its-reverse

Given a string s, find any substring of length 2 which is also present in the reverse of s.
Return true if such a substring exists, and false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: true
Explanation: Substring "ee" is of length 2 which is also present in reverse(s) == "edocteel".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcba"
Output: true
Explanation: All of the substrings of length 2 "ab", "bc", "cb", "ba" are also present in reverse(s) == "abcba".

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no substring of length 2 in s, which is also present in the reverse of s.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def isSubstringPresent(self, s: str) -> bool:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file "solution.py" and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file "solution.py" in the current directory.
3. Run '"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'python check_solution.py'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"' to test your solution with sample test cases.
4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all sample tests pass.

        """
        Find if any substring of length 2 is present in both s and reverse(s).

        Approach:
        - A 2-character substring exists in both s and reverse(s) if
          we can find two consecutive characters s[i], s[i+1] that also
          appear consecutively but reversed somewhere in s
        - This means checking if s[i+1:i+3] (reversed) appears in s
        - More efficient: check if for any pair of consecutive chars,
          the reversed pair appears elsewhere in the string

        Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of s
        Space Complexity: O(1)
        """
        # Get the reversed string
        reversed_s = s[::-1]

        # Check all substrings of length 2 in s
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            substring = s[i:i+2]

**Your Task:**
Evaluate this solution and provide a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how likely it is to correctly solve the problem.

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 1.0: Perfect solution, correctly handles all cases including edge cases
- 0.8-0.9: Very strong solution, likely correct with minor potential concerns
- 0.6-0.7: Good solution, but has some notable issues or missing edge cases
- 0.4-0.5: Partial solution with significant correctness concerns
- 0.2-0.3: Poor solution with major logical flaws
- 0.0-0.1: Completely incorrect or doesn'"'"'t address the problem

**Analysis Criteria:**
1. Does the algorithm logic correctly solve the problem?
2. Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, boundaries, special values)?
3. Is the time/space complexity acceptable for given constraints?
4. Are there any obvious bugs or logical errors?

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining your score]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.' 2>&1 </dev/null | tee /logs/agent/openhands.txt
