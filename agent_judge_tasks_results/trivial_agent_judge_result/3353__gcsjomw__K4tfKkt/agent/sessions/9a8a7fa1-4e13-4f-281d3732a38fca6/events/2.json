Evaluate the correctness and quality of the following code solution.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: existence-of-a-substring-in-a-string-and-its-reverse\n\nGiven a string s, find any substring of length 2 which is also present in the reverse of s.\nReturn true if such a substring exists, and false otherwise.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"leetcode\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Substring \"ee\" is of length 2 which is also present in reverse(s) == \"edocteel\".\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcba\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: All of the substrings of length 2 \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cb\", \"ba\" are also present in reverse(s) == \"abcba\".\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is no substring of length 2 in s, which is also present in the reverse of s.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 100\ns consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def isSubstringPresent(self, s: str) -> bool:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample test cases.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.\n5.

Does the algorithm logic correctly solve the problem?\n2. Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, boundaries, special values)?\n3. Is the time/space complexity acceptable for given constraints?\n4. Are there any obvious bugs or logical errors?\n\n**Required Action:**\nCreate a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:\n```\nScore: [0.0-1.0]\nReasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining your score]\n```\n\nDo not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.", "thought": ""}}
